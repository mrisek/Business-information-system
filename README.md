# Business-information-system
ASP.NET MVC web application and mobile application with responsive design. Monitoring of daily entries by the integration of Office 365 platform and MVC application.

The purpose of this project was to create modern ASP.MVC 5 application by integrating available services from Office 365 platform. This business information system is used for automatization of business processes of checking daily entries in a system. Microsoft Exchange 2013 service was used for sending e-mails, and Microsoft Azure platform was used along with other services like Web App, Scheduler or SQL Database that are in charge for application development, maintenance and database control. Mobile and web application both provide registration and login of users in a system, daily entry in a database and checkup if those entries were made on a daily basis. In case when entry wasn't made, an e-mail notification is sent to that user.
